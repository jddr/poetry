A dream within a dream
Edgar Allan Poe

Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now
Thus much let me avow
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night or in a day
in a vision or in none
is it therefore the less gone
All that we see or seem
is but a dream within a dream
